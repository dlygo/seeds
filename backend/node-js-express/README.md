# Node-Express Blueprints  (JavaScript Version)

This repository contains multiple blueprints (starter templates) for Node.js projects using Express.js with different
configurations and features as well as persistence options.

## Folder Structure

- **node-js-express-starter**: This contains a basic Node-Express seed to get you started with a simple "Hello, World!"
  API.
- **node-js-express-mongoose**: This seed incorporates Mongoose, enabling you to quickly start a project with MongoDB
  integration.
- **node-js-express-postgresql**: This seed incorporates Postgres, enabling you to quickly start a project with
  PostgreSQL integration.

## Code Style

The code style of these projects should be enforced by eslint to avoid messing up with your code editor configuration.
Make sure to check the existing node-js blueprints, to get an idea of the basic eslint configuration that you can
extend.

## Getting Started

To use any of the blueprints, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions in its README.
