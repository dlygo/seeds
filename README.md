Welcome to the Warestack Seeds Repository! This repository houses a collection of seed projects to help developers
kickstart their projects on the Warestack platform, spanning multiple technologies, frameworks, and configurations.

## What are Seeds?

Seeds are pre-configured project templates. Instead of starting from scratch, seeds provide developers with a
foundational codebase, configuration, and structure. This way, you can dive right into building features and
implementing your logic.

## Technologies & Frameworks Supported

- **Frontend Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.
- **Backend Frameworks**: Node.js, Django, Flask, etc.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kubernetes Jobs, etc.
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Keras, etc.
- ... and many more!

## How to Use a Seed

1. Browse the repository and locate a seed that matches your desired tech stack.
2. Clone the seed to your local environment.
3. Follow the specific README associated with that seed for setup instructions.
4. Start building!

## Contributing

We believe in the power of the community. If you've built or want to build a seed that isn't yet in this repository,
we'd love for you to contribute. Check out our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

### Labels for PRs

When creating a PR, make sure to attach appropriate labels. This helps in categorizing and reviewing PRs efficiently:

- `frontend`: For seeds related to frontend frameworks.
- `backend`: For backend-specific seeds.
- `data-processing`: For seeds focused on data processing techniques and tools.
- `ml/ai`: For seeds related to artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
- ... (you can extend this list based on the categories of seeds you anticipate)

## What Makes a Good Seed?

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every seed should have a detailed README explaining how to set up, use, and deploy
  the project.
- **Maintainability**: Code should be clean, readable, and modular.
- **Scalability**: Seeds should be designed with best practices in mind to scale efficiently.
- **Security**: Basic security practices should be in place.
- **Community Driven**: We value and appreciate every PR. Community feedback and improvements help in refining the
  seeds.
